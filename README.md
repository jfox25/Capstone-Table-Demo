## About
Cost is a full stack web application that help users manage their expenses. The core ideas of Cost is to allow users to easily add, view, and analyze their expenses, giving them clear insights into how better to manage their money. Users can add Business to the system for easy access, when creating expenses. Categories help users organize and breakdown their expenses too easily see where their money goes. Directives builds on this more, by grouping expenses into three distinct categories. Lots of expenses are repeated on a consistent or inconsistent basis, in order to prevent the need to re-enter expenses, Cost has Frequents. Frequents are a model of an expense that occurs in a userâ€™s daily life frequently. They can be used to quickly generate an expense, by storing business, directive, category, and price information. Great for repetitive, inconsistent expenses like a coffee order or a car wash. Frequents can also handle consistent expenses like rent or a gym memberships. In order to understand their expenses better, Cost provides users with leader board, chart, and table views. These views show relevant information to the user to help give them better insights into their data.
